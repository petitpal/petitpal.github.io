# Who am I?
My name is Paul. People started paying me to write code back in 1997. Since then I've written a lot of code, run a lot of production systems, and debugged a lot of problems. I've also run a lot of teams and interviewed a lot of people

I realised recently that much of what I learn is hidden away in markdown documents, often in private repositorys - while much of what I think about stays in my head or is monologued at any CTO foolish enough to ask... I thought a blog might be a nice
